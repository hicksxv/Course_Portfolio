        <h1>My Life</h1>
        <!-- 
          These images reflect my life right now and what I consider most important in most cases minus the games and food.
          These two are what I enjoy on my down time.

        <p>
            This is my curated collection of things that I love. Each item here represents something meaningful to me,
            whether it's a favorite book, game, album, rock, mineral, tool, art, or memory. This collection showcases
            how responsive design allows me to adapt my content across all screen sizes.
