      <h2>Background &amp; Education</h2>
      <p>
        I have obtained an Associates degree in Business and I am currently studying <strong>Computing Applications</strong> at <strong>Texas Tech University</strong>, where I focus on practical, hands-on skills in programming, software development and information technology.  This is designed to bridge the gap between theoretical computer science concepts and their real world applications across various industries.
