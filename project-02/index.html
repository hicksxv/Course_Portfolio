        <h1>Mission First Mindset While Building Reliable Solutions</h1>
        <h2>Veteran technologist with an IT background and an associate degree in business.</h2>
        <p>
          I combine the discipline and leadership gained from military service with hands‑on IT experience and business training to solve problems, support users, and keep systems running smoothly. I adapt quickly, communicate clearly, and enjoy turning complex challenges into practical, secure solutions.
