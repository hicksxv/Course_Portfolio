      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
       I am an Army veteran with a strong IT background and an associate degree in business, bringing a rare mix of technical expertise, discipline, and business awareness to every team I join. My military experience taught me how to stay calm under pressure, solve complex problems with limited resources, and lead diverse teams toward a clear mission. In IT, I have applied those same strengths to troubleshooting systems, supporting users, and learning new technologies quickly.

Because I understand both technology and business, I naturally look for solutions that are not just ‘technically correct’ but also efficient, cost‑conscious, and aligned with organizational goals. I am comfortable moving between roles—whether that means digging into technical issues, documenting processes, or communicating with non‑technical stakeholders. That versatility makes me effective in fast changing environments where priorities shift and people need someone who can adapt and deliver.

I am now looking for an opportunity where I can grow in a technical role, contribute to meaningful projects, and continue to build on my foundation in IT and business. Employers will find in me a dependable, mission‑driven professional who is coachable, detail‑oriented, and committed to doing things the right way. I am ready to bring my military mindset, technical skills, and business education together to add value from day one.

      <h2>Background &amp; Education</h2>
      <p>
        I have obtained an Associates degree in Business and I am currently studying <strong>Computing Applications</strong> at <strong>Texas Tech University</strong>, where I focus on practical, hands-on skills in programming, software development and information technology.  This is designed to bridge the gap between theoretical computer science concepts and their real world applications across various industries.
