        <h1>My Dev Tools Vandalism</h1>
        <p>
            I used browser developer tools to temporarily "vandalize" a
            website. Below is a screenshot showing my changes. These edits
            only appeared on my computer and did not affect the actual
            website.
        </p>
        <div class="screenshot-container">
            <!-- 
                IMPORTANT: Update the src attribute below to match your screenshot filename.
                Example: If your screenshot is named "apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png", change the line to:
                src="./apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png"
            -->
            <img src="./Guns UP.png" alt="Screenshot of the webpage I vandalized" />
        </div>
        <h2>What I "Vandalized"</h2>
        <p>
            Describe the changes you made to the website using the browser's developer tools. Some potential questions
            to consider:
        <ul>
            <li>What text did you edit?
                Main Page where it says "WHAT STARTS HERE CHANGES THE WORLD"
            </li>
            <li>What CSS properties did you modify?
                Changed the burnt orange in the ribbon to Raider Red and scrunched up the lettering in the banner to make it unreadable and difficult to navigate
            </li>
            <li>What made your edits interesting or amusing?
                I screenshot the picture at the right time that shows the women screaming and look like they are wearing a red and black cap and gown.
            </li>
            <li>Did you understand why some changes worked and some didn't?
                No
            </li>
            <li>Why did you choose the changes you did?</li>
            <li>Were you able to understand how the HTML and CSS worked together to make the changes you made?
                Yes, but not as indepth as I wanted
            </li>
            <li>Do you think you have a better sense of how dev tools can be used while crafting your own webpages?
                Yes more than before
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
